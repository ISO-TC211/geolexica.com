Geolexica has been updated to contain the latest officially translated terms from the
20190809 Edition of the ISO/TC 211 Multi-Lingual Glossary of Terms (MLGT).

The MLGT (20190809 Edition) contains the following terminology records:

* Arabic     684
* Chinese    479
* Danish     206
* Dutch       76
* English   1064
* Finnish    482
* French     479
* German     617 (definitions only)
* Japanese   151
* Korean     936
* Malay      318
* Polish     251
* Russian    941
* Spanish    1069 (including term equivalents)
* Swedish    681

The Malay terms are a new addition to Geolexica. While they were added to the MLGT
in 2018-11, they have not been offered through Geolexica.
