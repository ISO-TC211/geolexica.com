With the latest update of Geolexica, we are happy to announce that
origin information is now provided for every translated term.

The MLGT contains multiple registers (each in accordance with ISO 19135),
counting one per language.

As all terminology entries in Geolexica are imported directly from the MLGT,
we are now also able to import the metadata of the individual registers from within
the MLGT.

All Geolexica included registers are shown on the link:/registers/[Registers] page

On an individual concept page, under each term, you will now see a
row labeled "ORIGIN" displaying the origin information. The 
"ORIGIN" row contains the name of the register the term was sourced from,
and provides a link to examine more information about each register.

Specific contact information of the custodial organizations is not provided
as we encourage you to use our link:/feedback/[Feedback] link to provide your comments.

We look forward hearing from you on how Geolexica can better serve your needs!
